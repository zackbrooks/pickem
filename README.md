## How It's Made

**Tech used:** MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS, Material UI, React Query

Going through forums I often ran across people doing pickems for various evnts. One was a nfl pickem leauge that the person did manually, I also ran across posts running a pickem for a wrestling PPV or MMA/Boxing cards. I thought it would be a neat idea to make a site that offers users the ablity to make their own custom pickems and just give a link to users allowing them to join the league with a password.
